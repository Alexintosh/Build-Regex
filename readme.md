# Build RegEx

Regular Expressions are hard (for me at least). Why struggle with them? Because of their power!

**Build RegEx** is proudly built using [VerbalExpressions.js](http://github.com/jehna/VerbalExpressions/). All I did was turn it into a GUI. You're welcome :)

## Features

- Choose your options and text to match against
- Add more match options
- Drag & Drop to reorder your match options
- Select which modifiers to use (global, case insensitive, multi line)
- Grab a beer with the extra time you just saved!
